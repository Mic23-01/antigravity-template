# Product Strategy & Vision 🚀

## 1. Vision Statement
To establish **Antigravity** as the definitive operational foundation for Agentic AI development in 2026, eliminating the fragility of experimental systems by providing a rigorous, self-correcting infrastructure.

## 2. Primary Objective
Reduce the "Double Penalty" of agent interaction to zero through real-time persistence, automated audit trails, and deterministic verification protocols.

## 3. 12-Month Roadmap
- **Q1 - Foundation**: Reach "Gold Standard" v1.0 (Current). Complete English-first standardization and Sentinel robustness.
- **Q2 - Scale**: Implementation of advanced MCP orchestration and multi-agent synergy.
- **Q3 - Intelligence**: Deepening the capability of the automated Gap Analysis and Hydration workflows.
- **Q4 - Community**: Release as a stabilized, project-agnostic template for wider industrial adoption.

## 4. Key Success Metrics
- **Success Rate**: 100% execution of defined Workflows without manual intervention.
- **Persistence Fidelity**: 0% loss of technical context between agent swaps.
- **Hydration Speed**: Total project initialization time < 5 minutes.
