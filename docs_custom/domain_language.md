# Domain Language & Glossary 🧠

## 1. Core Terminology
- **Antigravity (AG)**: The internal name for the agentic framework and its specific implementation.
- **Workflow**: A standardized operational procedure (SOP) defined as an interactive markdown protocol.
- **Skill**: A modular, executable toolkit containing specific logic (e.g., `fixlog_writer`).
- **Sentinel**: The persistence gatekeeper that monitors file modifications and ensures every action is logged.
- **Hydration**: The process of transforming a generic template into a project-aware specialized system.

## 2. Operational Semantics
- **Double Penalty**: The cognitive load required to understand what an agent did after it acted. AG aims to eliminate this via Checkpoints.
- **Gold Standard**: The highest level of operational maturity for an agentic project (v1.0+).
- **Dirty Session**: A state where filesystem changes have been made without a corresponding FixLog persistence.
